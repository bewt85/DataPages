  Aliivibrio salmonicida:
    description: |
      _Alivibrio salmonicida_ is a gram negative marine bacterium that is a cause of cold-water vibriosis in Atlantic salmon; it is related to the human pathogens _Alivibrio cholerae_, _Alivibrio parahemolyticus_ and _Alivibrio vulnificus_. 
      
      The Sanger Institute completed the sequencing of _Alivibrio salmonicida_ strain LFI1238 in collaboration with Prof. Nils-Peder Willassen of the [Protein Research Group](http://cold.imb.fm.uit.no/ProteinGroup/Projects/), Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Medical Biology [University of Tromso](http://www2.uit.no/ikbViewer/page/startsida).
    published_data_description: |
      The completed sequence consists of two chromosomes of length 3,325,165 bp and 1,206,461 with a G+C content of 38.96%. Additionally, there are 4 plasmids: two larger plasmids of 83,540 bp and 30,807 bp and two smaller plasmids of 5360 bp and 4327 bp. 
      
      The chromosomes are deposited in the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession numbers [FM178379](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178379&style=raw) and [FM178380](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178380&style=raw) and the plasmids are similarly availalbe with accession numbers [FM178381](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178381&style=raw), [FM178382](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178382&style=raw), [FM178383](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178383&style=raw) and [FM178384](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FM178384&style=raw).

  Aliivibrio wodanis:
    description: |
      _Aliivibrio wodanis_ is one of the causative agents of winter ulcer. The disease affects both Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) and rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) and results in increased mortality rates as well as major economical losses due to downgrading fish at slaughter. 
      
      The aim on this project is to sequence the genomes of M_. viscosa_ and _A. wodanis_. Since _A. wodanis_ and _A. salmonicida_ are closely related, and both important economic fish pathogens, this will provide an excellent comparator genome. Also this will allow the identification of genes that are potentially involved in virulence, and may highlight new targets for vaccine development. However, since we aim to look at the possible interactions between _M. viscosa_ and _A. wodanis_ the genomes will also support the biological program that will run alongside the genome sequencing.

  Bordetella:
    description: |
      The genus Bordetella comprises Gram-negative beta-proteobacteria including three species which are human pathogens; _Bordetella pertussis_, _Bordetella parapertussis_ and _Bordetella bronchiseptica_. B. _pertussis_, and occasionally B. _parapertussis_, can cause whooping cough in human infants. B. _pertussis_ only infects humans while B. _parapertussis_ infects both humans and sheep. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that B. _parapertussis_ strains isolated from humans are distinct from those isolated from sheep, and there is little or no transmission between the two reservoirs (sheep and human). B. _bronchiseptica_ colonize the respiratory tracts of a range of mammals, but can also persist in the environment for extended periods. It causes chronic and often asymptomatic respiratory infections in a wide range of animals, but only occasionally in humans. A related species, B. _avium_ causes disease (bordetellosis) in commercially grown turkeys, but is also found in a variety of healthy wild and domesticated birds. 
      
      The Sanger Institute has been funded by the Wellcome Trust to sequence the genomes of _Bordetella pertussis strain_ Tohama I, _B. parapertussis_ strain 12822 and _B. bronchiseptica_ strain RB50 in collaboration with Duncan Maskell and Andrew Preston of the Centre for Veterinary Science, Dept. of Clinical Veterinary medicine, The University of Cambridge. The sequences and analysis are described in: Parkhill et al (2003) Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of _Bordetella pertussis_, _Bordetella parapertussis_ and _Bordetella bronchiseptica_. Nature Genetics 35 32-40 (DOI: 10.1038/Ng1227), and have been submitted to EMBL/GenBank with the accession numbers: [BX470248](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX470248&style=raw) (_B. pertussis_), [BX470249](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX470249&style=raw) (_B. parapertussis_) and [BX470250](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX470250&style=raw) (_B. bronchiseptica_). 
      
      The three sequenced _Bordetella_ strains have been deposited with the ATCC and NCTC under the following accession numbers: _Bordetella parapertussis_ 12822: ATCC BAA-587, NCTC 13253 _Bordetella bronchiseptica_ RB50: ATCC BAA-588, NCTC 13252 _Bordetella pertussis_ Tohama I: ATCC BAA-589, NCTC 13251 
      
      _We have have also sequenced three closely related isolates of a _B. pertussis_ bacteriophage that exhibited a novel mechanism of host range variation. The mechanism is described in Liu et al, Science 295, 2091 (2002), and the bacteriophage sequences were _published in Liu et al, J Bacteriol 186, 1503-1517 (2004), and are available from Genbank/EMBL as: [AY029185](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AY029185&style=raw), [AY526908](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AY526908&style=raw) and [AY526909](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AY526909&style=raw). 
      
      We have also been funded by the USDA to sequence the genome of _Bordetella avium_ strain 197N in collaboration with Louise Temple of the Department of Biology, James Madison University 
      
      ###  _Bordetella bronchiseptica_ complex sequencing
      
      The Sanger Institute has completed a project to sequence further strains within the _Bordetella bronchiseptica_ complex to investigate the evolutionary history and host tropism differences within this group of organsims. The strain selection is based on the MLST tree published in Diavatopoulos et al, PLoS Pathog. 1, e45 (2005). 
      
      This work is being done in collaboration with Dr. Craig Cummings and Prof. David Relman (Relman Lab, Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, SUMC, Stanford University), Prof. Eric Harvill (Centre for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Penn State University), Dr. Andrew Preston (Univeristy of Bristol), Dr. Frits Mooi (Laboratory for Infectious Diseases and Perinatal Screening, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, Netherlands) and Dr. Jeff F. Miller (Department of Micribiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA). 
      
      The strains selected for sequencing included : 
      
      _B. bronchiseptica_ strain 253 (ST27) 
      
      _B. pertussis_ strain 18323 (ST24) 
      
      _B. parapertussis_ (ovine) Bpp5 (ST16) 
      
      _B. bronchiseptica_ strain MO149 (ST15) 
      
      _B. bronchiseptica_ strain D445 
      
      _B. bronchiseptica_ Bbr77 
      
      _B. bronchiseptica_ strain 1289

  Burkholderia:
    description: |
      Burkholderia is a genus of Proteobacteria. It's pathogenic members include: 
      
        * _Burkholderia cenocepacia_ (formerly _Burkholderia cepacia_ genomovar III, and before that _Pseudomonas cepacia_), a Gram negative bacterium which is ubiquitous in the environment and may cause a number of diseases in plants. Human infection can be caused by _B. cepacia_, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease, and is often fatal. 
        * _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (previously called _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_), the causative agent of melioidosis, a serious disease of man and animals that occurs primarily in S.E. Asia, N. Australia and other tropical areas. _B. pseudomallei_ is an environmental Gram-negative saprophyte present in wet soil and rice paddies in endemic areas. The highest documented infection rate is in northeastern Thailand, where melioidosis accounts for 20% of all community-acquired septicaemias. Disease occurs after bacterial contamination of breaks in the skin or by inhalation after contact with water or soil. There is no licensed vaccine against meliodosis, and the bacterium is resistant to many antibiotics. _B. pseudomallei_ strain K96243 is a clinical isolate from Thailand, supplied by Dr. S. Songsivilai of Mahidol University. 
      
      ###  _Burkholderia cenocepacia_
      
      The Sanger Institute has completed the sequencing of and published the 8.06 Mb genome of _Burkholderia cenocepacia_ strain J2315, in collaboration with Dr. Eshwar Mahenthiralingham of the School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Prof. John Govan of the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Edinburgh, Prof. C.A. Hart of the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Liverpool, and Prof. Peter Vandamme of the Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent, Belgium. 
      
      Note that _B. cenocepacia_ J2315 has recently been renamed from _B. cepacia_ J2315. 
      
      The sequenced strain, J2315, is a genomovar III strain of the ET12 lineage, and is the index strain for transmission of this strain among CF patients in the UK. Strain J2315 has been deposited as LMG 16656 in the [Belgium Coordinated Collection of Microorganisms](http://bccm.belspo.be/index.php). 
      
      The sequence and annotation of the Burkholderia cenocepacia strain J2315 genome have been deposited in the EMBL database under accession numbers [AM747720](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM747720&style=raw), [AM747721](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM747721&style=raw), [AM747722](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM747722&style=raw) and [AM747723](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM747723&style=raw)
      
      Shotgun and assembly data from this project are available from our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/bc/). 
      
      ###  _Burkholderia pseudomallei_
      
      The Sanger Institute has published the 7.2 Mb genome of Burkholderia pseudomallei in collaboration with Dr. Rick Titball of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, and Dr. Ty Pitt of the Heath Protection Agency. We have sequenced strain K96243, a clinical isolate from Thailand, supplied by Dr. S. Songsivilai of Mahidol University. This project is funded by Beowulf Genomics. 
      
      The reference genome is 7,247,547 bp in size with a G+C content of 68.06% consisting of two chromosomes of 4,074,542 bp and 3,173,005 bp. The sequence is available for download by FTP and can be searched using our BLAST server. 
      
      The two fully annotated chromosomal sequences are deposited in the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession numbers [BX571965](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX571965&style=raw) and [BX571966](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX571966&style=raw).

  Burkholderia pseudomallei:
    description: |
      _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (previously called _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_) is the causative agent of melioidosis, a serious disease of man and animals that occurs primarily in S.E. Asia, N. Australia and other tropical areas. _B. pseudomallei_ is an environmental Gram-negative saprophyte present in wet soil and rice paddies in endemic areas. The highest documented infection rate is in northeastern Thailand, where melioidosis accounts for 20% of all community-acquired septicaemias. Disease occurs after bacterial contamination of breaks in the skin or by inhalation after contact with water or soil. There is no licensed vaccine against meliodosis, and the bacterium is resistant to many antibiotics. _B. pseudomallei_ strain K96243 is a clinical isolate from Thailand, supplied by Dr. S. Songsivilai of Mahidol University. 
      
      The Sanger Institute has published the 7.2 Mb genome of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ in collaboration with Dr. Rick Titball of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, and Dr. Ty Pitt of the Heath Protection Agency. We have sequenced strain K96243, a clinical isolate from Thailand, supplied by Dr. S. Songsivilai of Mahidol University. This project is funded by Beowulf Genomics.

  Campylobacter:
    description: |
      _Campylobacter_ is a genus of gram negative bacteria. Most _Campylobacter_ species are pathogenic. Over a dozen species are known to cause human disease. These include: 
      
        * _Campylobacter coli_ which is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract of poulty, pigs and humans and can cause enteritis in pigs and humans. 
        * _Campylobacter jejuni_ which is the leading cause of food poisoning, being three times more common than _Salmonella_. 
      
      ###  _Campylobacter coli_
      
      The Sanger Institute has sequenced a number of _C. coli_ genomes as part of a project to look at the exchange of DNA between members of the genus to better understand their evolution. 
      
      ###  _Campylobacter jejuni_
      
      The genome sequence of _C. jejuni_ was produced in collaboration with Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Dr. Julian Ketley of the Department of Genetics, University of Leicester. It was sequenced using a whole genome shotgun approach using several 1.4-2.2 kb pUC18 libraries, both generated in-house, and supplied by Andrey V. Karlyshev from Dr. Wren's laboratory. 
      
      ###  Reannotation of the _Campylobacter jejuni_ NCTC11168
      
      In August 2006, Ozan Gundogdu from The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine in collaboration with the Sanger Institute, carried out a complete re-annotation of the NCTC11168 genome. The re-annotation has added new information to over 1450 of the original 1654 coding sequences with over 300 product functions being updated. Additional Campylobacter work carried out in Brendan Wren's group can be accessed from the Campylobacter Resource Facility [homepage](http://crf.lshtm.ac.uk/).
    published_data_description: |
      The complete sequence is 1,641,481 bp in length (with 25 polymorphic regions) and was generated from 33,824 sequencing reads. It starts at the first base in the dnaA gene, close to the origin of replication. Both the sequence and annotation have been deposited in the public databases with the ID CJ11168 (accession number [AL111168](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AL111168&style=raw)). Shotgun and assembly data from this project are available from our <ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/cj/>[ FTP site]. 
      
      ## 454/Roche Sequence
      
      We have also generated sequence data from _C. jejuni_ M1 using the 454/Roche GS20 system. The sequence is in 624 contigs with a total size of 1.619 Mb and may be downloaded from our <ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/cj/>[ FTP site]. Please note that this sequence is unchecked and unedited, and will contain errors. The GS20 is known to have problems with homopolymeric tracts, and these are therefore likely to contain significant numbers of errors.

  Chlamydia:
    description: |
      The genus _Chlamydia_ consists of three species of obligate intracellular pathogens. 
      
      These include _Chlamydia trachomatis_ which is the major cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the UK and globally accounts for &gt; 89 million STI cases. Complications caused by the genital tract _C. trachomatis_ biovariants include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women, and epididymitis in men. Ocular biovariants of _C. trachomatis_ are also the leading cause of preventable blindness (trachoma) in the developing world causing acute or sub-acute follicular conjunctivitis (inclusion conjunctivitis), which may progress to punctate keratitis, scarring and trachoma. 
      
      We have also studied the third biovariant of _C. trachomatis_, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which infect monocytes and disseminate to the local lymph nodes, where they can cause large swellings characteristic of bubonic diseases. Although rare in the UK, LGV serovars are endemic in parts of Africa, South East Asia, South America and the Caribbean. Recently an 'epidemic' clinical LGV isolate causing proctitis emerged and spread globally in the men who have sex with men (MSM) community. It had been speculated that this isolate was a new more infectious form on LGV. We have shown that epidemic strain was simply a classical LGV isolate that had been circulating in the human population for a long time and was in fact an old strain causing a new disease. 
      
      Previous work focused on a new variant of the genital tract _C. trachomatis_ (nvCT) which emerged in Sweden. This variant escaped routine diagnostic tests because it carries a plasmid with a deletion. Failure to detect this strain meant it spread rapidly across the country provoking a worldwide alert. In addition to being a key diagnostic target, the plasmid has been linked to chlamydial virulence. We defined the evolutionary relationship between the chromosome and plasmid and since the PCR diagnostic test remains the method of choice for routine diagnosis we also identified more robust diagnostic markers located on plasmid. 
      
      Current work focuses on the global diversity of _C. trachomatis_.

  Chlamydia trachomatis:
    description: |
      _C. trachomatis_ is the major cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the UK and globally accounts for &gt; 89 million STI cases. Complications caused by the genital tract _C. trachomatis_ biovariants include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women, and epididymitis in men. Ocular biovariants of _C. trachomatis_ are also the leading cause of preventable blindness (trachoma) in the developing world causing acute or sub-acute follicular conjunctivitis (inclusion conjunctivitis), which may progress to punctate keratitis, scarring and trachoma. 
      
      We have also studied the third biovariant of _C. trachomatis_, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which infect monocytes and disseminate to the local lymph nodes, where they can cause large swellings characteristic of bubonic diseases. Although rare in the UK, LGV serovars are endemic in parts of Africa, South East Asia, South America and the Caribbean. Recently an 'epidemic' clinical LGV isolate causing proctitis emerged and spread globally in the men who have sex with men (MSM) community. It had been speculated that this isolate was a new more infectious form on LGV. We have shown that epidemic strain was simply a classical LGV isolate that had been circulating in the human population for a long time and was in fact an old strain causing a new disease. 
      
      Previous work focused on a new variant of the genital tract _C. trachomatis_ (nvCT) which emerged in Sweden. This variant escaped routine diagnostic tests because it carries a plasmid with a deletion. Failure to detect this strain meant it spread rapidly across the country provoking a worldwide alert. In addition to being a key diagnostic target, the plasmid has been linked to chlamydial virulence. We defined the evolutionary relationship between the chromosome and plasmid and since the PCR diagnostic test remains the method of choice for routine diagnosis we also identified more robust diagnostic markers located on plasmid. 
      
      Current work focuses on the global diversity of _C. trachomatis_.

  Chlamydophila abortus:
    description: |
      _Chlamydophila abortus_ is an intracellular Gram negative bacterial pathogen that is endemic throughout the world. _C. abortus_ is the most common cause of infectious abortion in small ruminants (sheep and goats) in the UK, where it accounts for around 50% of all diagnosed abortions. It also causes abortion in cattle and pigs, and represents a significant zoonotic risk to pregnant women. The diseases caused by both pathogens result in enormous economic costs to their respective livestock industries. 
      
      _Chlamydophila abortus_ is a member of the _Chlamydiaceae_, a phylogenetically distinct Gram negative bacterial family, encompassing two genera (_Chlamydia_ and _Chlamydophila_), which are subdivided into three (_Chlamydia muridarum_, _Chlamydia suis_, and _Chlamydia trachomatis_) and six (_Chlamydophila pneumoniae_, _Chlamydophila abortus_, _Chlamydophila caviae_, _Chlamydophila felis_, _Chlamydophila pecorum_ and _Chlamydophila psittaci_) defined species, respectively (Everett et al. 1999). _Chlamydiaceae_ undergo a unique biphasic developmental cycle switching from an infectious, but metabolically inactive, form called the elementary body (EB) to the non-infectious, metabolically active cell type known as the reticulate body (RB). The infectious process is initiated by the attachment of EBs to susceptible host cells, particularly mucosal epithelial cells. Upon entry the EB differentiates into the metabolically active form, RB, which multiplies by binary fission within specialised intracellular vacuoles called inclusions. These inclusions evade fusion with lysosomes, thus avoiding the host endocytic pathway, but instead intercept the exocytic pathway, appearing as secretory vacuoles to the host cell (Hackstadt et al. 1997). RBs transform back into EBs 2-3 days after infection (depending on species) and are then released by lysis or exocytosis to complete the infectious process. EBs can be spread by aerosols, through ingestion and by direct physical contact.

      We have determined the complete genome sequence of a low passage strain of _Cp. abortus_ (S26/3) and have a continued interest in the genome diversity of this species. This performed in collaboration with Dr. David Longbottom of the Moredun Research Institute and was funded by The Scottish Office (SEERAD). 
      
      The annotated genome sequence is avialable in the EMBL/GenBank databases with the accession number [CR848038](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=CR848038&style=raw).

  Citrobacter:
    description: |
      _Citrobacter_ is a genus of Gram-negative enteric bacteria. It include _Citrobacter rodentium_ whose cognate host is mice where it causes transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia, and is responsible for high mortality in suckling mice (Barthold et al., 1978; Schauer &amp; Falkow, 1993; Schauer et al., 1995). _Citrobacter_ species are widely distributed in nature, frequently present in soil and water, and can be readily isolated from human and animal faeces. However, unlike the host-adapted _C. rodentium_ that causes gastrointestinal disease, the other _Citrobacter_ species are opportunistic pathogens that cause a variety of extraintestinal infections (Luperchio &amp; Schauer, 2001). Although disease caused by _C. rodentium_ has been observed primarily in mice, this bacterium has also been reported to cause disease with a high rate of fatality in other rodents (de la Puente-Redondo et al., 1999). There are no reports of _C. rodentium_ being pathogenic to humans. 
      
      ###  _Citrobacter rodentium_
      
      _C. rodentium_ is a member of the attaching and effacing (A/E) family of bacterial pathogens, which is characterised by intimate bacterial adherence to host intestinal epithelial cells, effacement of microvilli, and reorganisation of the host actin cytoskeleton to form pedestal-like extensions of epithelial cells beneath the adherent bacteria called A/E lesions (Wales et al., 2005). Gastrointestinal colonisation and formation of A/E lesions is mediated by a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which is conserved among A/E bacteria (Deng et al., 2001; Wales et al., 2005). _C. rodentium_ is unique amongst _Citrobacter_ species in possessing the LEE (Schauer &amp; Falkow, 1993; Schauer et al., 1995). As the only known A/E pathogen to naturally infect mice, it is a valuable model organism for the study of pathogenesis of the clinically significant human pathogens, enteropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC).

  Corynebacterium:
    description: |
      The genus _Corynebacterium_ consists of Gram-positive aerobic, rod shaped bacteria. These include _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ which produces a potent bacteriophage-encoded protein exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, which causes the symptoms of diphtheria. This potentially fatal infectious disease is controlled in many developed countries by an effective immunisation programme. However, the disease has made a dramatic return in recent years, in particular within the Eastern European region. 
      
      _C. diphtheriae_ biotype gravis strain NCTC13129 was isolated in 1997 from a 72-year-old female with clinical diphtheria who had returned to the UK from a Baltic cruise.
    published_data_description: |
      The _C. diphtheriae_ NCTC 13129 genome is composed of a single circular chromosome of 2,488,635 bp, and was sequenced in collaboration with Dr. Androulla Efstratiou of the W.H.O. collaborating centre for diphtheria, Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory, at the Health Protection Agency. 
      
      The fully annotated genome is available from the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession number [BX248353](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=BX248353&style=raw).

  Helicobacter:
    description: |
      _Helicobacter_ is a genus of Gram-negative Epsilon Proteobacteria with characteristic helix shaped cells and are often found in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract of mammals and some birds. _Helicobacter pylori_ infects up to 50% of the human population and is strongly associated with peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, and stomach cancer. 
      
      _Helicobacter mustelae_ is a pathogen of ferrets, where it causes general pathology and ulceration in a similar manner to _H. pylori_ in humans. It provides a genetically tractable animal model for ulceration and gastric cancer. The Sanger Institute has been funded by the Wellcome Trust to sequence the genome of _Helicobacter mustelae_ strain ATCC 43772 in collaboration with Dr. Paul O'Toole of the Department of Microbiology, University College Cork, Ireland. Comparative genome analysis of _H. pylori_, the extragastric _H. hepaticus_, and _H. mustelae_, will provide new insights into genes involved in gastric and extragastric virulence in this genus. This analysis has recently been published by O’Toole et al. (PMID: 20219135). 
      
      The Sanger Institute has initiated a Wellcome Trust project to sequence the genomes of representative of each of the major _Helicobacter_ species in collaboration with Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

    description: |
      _Klebsiella_ is a genus of non-motile, Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped bacteria of the family _Enterobacteriaceae_. 
      
      Amnogst it's species is _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ which has a world-wide distribution causing disease in a highly diverse group of hosts including humans, animals and plants. Relatively little is known about the evolution of _K. pneumoniae_. _K. pneumoniae_ is an important cause of human disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in the developed world and one of the most common causes of community acquired infections in Asia, causing diseases including pneumonia, liver abscess and septicemia. In developed countries, _K. pneumoniae_ is typically a nosocomial pathogen responsible for sepsis, urinary tract infections and pneumonia _K. pneumoniae_ is also a common veterinary pathogen, causing mastitis in dairy cows and an infection of the uterus in horses. Furthermore, _K. pneumoniae_ is a plant endophyte, illustrating the broad host range of this bacterium. We are aiming to capture a snap shot of the global diversity held within this species and have put together a strain collection for sequencing accordingly.

  Legionella:
    published_data_description: |
      The genome of _Legionella pneumophila_ was sequenced using paired-end 454 FLX pyrosequencing and assembled using the 454/Roche Newbler assembly program into 274 contigs. These contigs were scaffolded using paired read into 11 scaffolds. Several contig gaps were closed using PCR and Sanger sequencing in conjunction with manual examination of the individual 454 reads in Consed. Unassembled contigs of less than 300bp were removed from the end of the assembly. This gave a total sequence length of 3,473,547 bp assembled into 145 contigs in 4 scaffolds plus 14 small contigs (114 – 3270 bp) which could not be scaffolded. 
      
      The genome has been sequenced in collaboration with Prof. Gad Frankel (Imperial College) and is available from the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession number [FR687201](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=FR687201&style=raw).

  Leptospira interrogans:
    description: |
      Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by pathogenic members of the genus, primarily _L. interrogans_. Human disease usually occurs through environmental exposure to soil or water contaminated with _Leptospira_ shed in the urine of an infected animal. Clinical manifestations are broad with symptoms including chills, headache, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion, and abdominal symptoms which can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The disease has a worldwide distribution but is most common in tropical regions where incidence peaks during the rainy season. 
      
      The Sanger Institute has been funded by the Wellcome Trust to sequence the genomes from a collection of _Leptospira interrogans_ isolates representing much of the diversity within the species.

  Moritella viscosa:
    description: |
      _Moritella viscosa_ is one of the causative agents of winter ulcer. The disease affects both Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) and rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) and results in increased mortality rates as well as major economical losses due to downgrading fish at slaughter. 
      
      The aim on this project will be to sequence the genomes of M_. viscosa_ and _A. wodanis_. Since _A. wodanis_ and _A. salmonicida_ are closely related, and both important economic fish pathogens, this will provide an excellent comparator genome. Also this will allow the identification of genes that are potentially involved in virulence, and may highlight new targets for vaccine development. However, since we aim to look at the possible interactions between _M. viscosa_ and _A. wodanis_ the genomes will also support the biological program that will run alongside the genome sequencing.

  Peptoclostridium:
    aliases:
    - Clostridium difficile
    description: |
      _Peptoclostridium_ is a genus of bacteria including the species _Peptoclostridium difficile_, a major nosocomial pathogen world-wide causing disease ranging from antibiotic-associated diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. 
      
      ###  _Peptoclostridium difficile_
      
      We have completed the genome sequencing of _Peptoclostridium difficile_ strain 630. Strain 630 is multi-drug resistant, and was isolated from a patient with severe PMC that had spread to dozens of other patients on the same ward in Zurich, Switzerland in 1982. Thus strain 630 has the genetic attributes of a fully virulent, highly transmissible, drug resistant strain. This work was carried out in collaboration with Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Neil Fairweather and Gordon Dougan of the Centre for Molecular Microbiology and Infection, Imperial College, London and Peter Mullany of the Eastman Dental Institute, London. 
      
      We have also sequenced several other strains of _P. difficile_, including _P. difficile_ strain R20291 (SM), _P. difficile_ strain 196, _CP. difficile_ strain BI1, _P. difficile_ strain M120 and _P. difficile_ strain M68. 
      
      ###  Published Reference Genome
      
      The Sanger Institute completed the sequencing of _Peptoclostridium difficile_ strain 630 (epidemic type X) in 2006. The genome consists of a circular chromosome of 4,290,252 bp with a G+C content of 29.06%, and a circular plasmid of 7,881 bp with a G+C content of 27.9%. The fully annotated chromosome and plasmid are available from the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession numbers [AM180355](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM180355&style=raw) and [AM180356](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM180356&style=raw) respectively. Using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach the annotation of _Peptoclostridium difficile _ strain 630 has been updated in 2014 and is available as an embl file. This embl file contains functional class and colour annotation characterising genes into broad functional groups that is not present on the updated EMBL/GenBank version. The embl file along with the key to the colour and class annotation is available from our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/cd/). The original shotgun and assembly data can also still be accessed here. The embl file can be interrogated using Artemis which is available as a free download from the Related links on this page.

  Peptoclostridium difficile:
    aliases:
    - Clostridium difficile
    description: |
      _Peptoclostridium difficile_ is a major nosocomial pathogen world-wide causing disease ranging from antibiotic-associated diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. 
      
      We have completed the genome sequencing of _Peptoclostridium difficile_ strain 630. Strain 630 is multi-drug resistant, and was isolated from a patient with severe PMC that had spread to dozens of other patients on the same ward in Zurich, Switzerland in 1982. Thus strain 630 has the genetic attributes of a fully virulent, highly transmissible, drug resistant strain. This work was carried out in collaboration with Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Neil Fairweather and Gordon Dougan of the Centre for Molecular Microbiology and Infection, Imperial College, London and Peter Mullany of the Eastman Dental Institute, London. 
      
      We have also sequenced several other strains of _P. difficile_, including _P. difficile_ strain R20291 (SM), _P. difficile_ strain 196, _P. difficile_ strain BI1, _P. difficile_ strain M120 and _P. difficile_ strain M68.

      ###  Published Reference Genome
      
      The Sanger Institute completed the sequencing of _Peptoclostridium difficile_ strain 630 (epidemic type X) in 2006. The genome consists of a circular chromosome of 4,290,252 bp with a G+C content of 29.06%, and a circular plasmid of 7,881 bp with a G+C content of 27.9%. The fully annotated chromosome and plasmid are available from the EMBL/GenBank databases with accession numbers [AM180355](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM180355&style=raw) and [AM180356](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch?db=embl&id=AM180356&style=raw) respectively. Using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach the annotation of _Peptoclostridium difficile _ strain 630 has been updated in 2014 and is available as an embl file. This embl file contains functional class and colour annotation characterising genes into broad functional groups that is not present on the updated EMBL/GenBank version. The embl file along with the key to the colour and class annotation is available from our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/cd/). The original shotgun and assembly data can also still be accessed here. The embl file can be interrogated using Artemis which is available as a free download from the Related links on this page.

  Pseudomonas:
    description: |
      Pseudomonads are ubiquitous organisms distributed widely in the environment, including the soil and water and in association with various living host organisms. There are representatives such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ that represent one of the most prevalent causes of opportunistic infections in humans and is the most common cause of eventually fatal, persistent respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Others such as _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ represent a physiologically diverse species that contributes greatly to the turnover of organic matter and, while present in soil, is abundant on the surfaces of plant roots and leaves. Of the plant-colonizing strains, some isolates are known to positively affect plant health and nutrition. The mechanistic bases of these effects remain unclear, but are known to include the production of plant-growth hormones, the suppression of pathogens (especially fungi and oomycetes) detrimental to plant health via competitive and / or allelopathic effects, and the direct elicitation of plant defence responses. 
      
      To date we have determined the genome sequence of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) of _P. aeruginosa_ and _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ strain SBW25

These and other cellulolytic bacteria play an important role in the digestion of hemicellulose and cellulose plant cell walls. They possess "cellulosomes," which are surface structures anchored to the bacterial cell wall and consist of a scaffold to which attach several different carbohydrate binding modules possessing cellulase and hemicellulase activities (Bayer et al 2008 The Chemical Record 8: 364-377; Fontes and Gilbert 2010 Ann Rev Biochem 79:23.1-23.27). _Ruminococcus flavefaciens_ strain 007C was isolated from the rumen of a cow (Stewart et al., J Appl Bacteriol 1990 68:349-56) and possesses a novel cell surface-anchored cellulose binding protein. (Rincon et al., J. Bacteriol 2007 Jul; 189(13):4774-83). 
      
      The _Ruminococcus flavefaciens_ strain 007C genome was sequenced in collaboration with [Prof. Harry Flint](http://www.rowett.ac.uk/divisions/ghp/hf_group.html) of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, Aberdeen.

  Salmonella:
    description: |
      _Salmonella_ classification is extremely complex; based on DNA-DNA hybridisation results the genus _Salmonella_ is divided into two species: _Salmonella enterica_ and _Salmonella bongori_. _S. enterica_ is then further divided into six distinct subspecies (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and VI), based on biochemical differences. The genus _Salmonella_ is further divided by serology into over 2,500 serovars using the Kauffman and White scheme (Popoff and LeMinor 2001). This classification scheme defines the serogroup according to expression of somatic lipopolysaccharide O antigens, and the serovar by expression of flagellar H antigens. Contained within the genus _Salmonella_ are bacterial pathogens able to cause a spectrum of diseases in an array of different hosts and which are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both humans and animals. _S. enterica_ subspecies I contains most species that cause disease in warm-blooded animals and includes examples of both promiscuous and host adapted pathotypes. We have generated reference whole genome sequences for the major human pathogenic serotypes of _S. enterica_ and several that are important animal pathogens including _S._ Typhi, _S._ Typhimurium, _S._ Paratyphi A, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Gallinarum, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Hadar and _S._ Virchow. Within this collection we have defined the genomes of salmonellae able to infect a broad range of hosts including _S._ Typhimurium which causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans and a systemic infection in mice and those that are host restricted including _S._ Typhi which causes typhoid fever in humans. From these genomes we have shown patterns of evolution that have involved gene acquisition mediated by phage or other mobile genetic elements as well as functional gene loss (see above). We have also shown that some _S. enterica_ serovars such as _S._ Gallinarum although restricted to chickens has only recently evolved, largely by genome degradation, from a broad host range serovar: _S._ Enteritidis. To extend our observations and understand the major themes that describe _Salmonella_ evolution we are now sampling more broadly to look at more diverse serotypes and subspecies of _S._ enterica. 
      
      The Wellcome Trust Sanger Insitute is involved in several _Salmonella_ sequencing projects. 
      
      ###  _Salmonella enterica_ Typhi Project
      
      The Wellcome Trust Sanger Insitute pathogen genomics group was funded to sequence _Salmonella_ Typhi strain CT18 in collaboration with [Prof. Gordon Dougan](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/gdougan/). This strain is a highly pathogenic, multiple drug resistant strain isolated from a typhoid patient in Cho Quan Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
      
      An additional 19 stains were then sequenced using both 454 and Illumina/Solexa rapid sequencing technologies. 
      
      ###  _Salmonella enterica_ Paratyphi A Project
      
      The Wellcome Trust Sanger Insitute pathogen genomivs group was funded to sequence _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A strain AKU_12601 in collaboration with [Prof. Gordon Dougan](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/gdougan/). 
      
      ###  _Salmonella_ spp. comparative sequencing Project
      
      The Sanger Institute extended its program of comparative _Salmonella_ sequencing to include further serovars of _S. enterica_ in collaboration with [Prof. Gordon Dougan](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/gdougan/), Dr. Paul Barrow of the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, and Dr. Mark Achtman of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin.

  Staphylococcus:
    description: |
      _Staphylococcus_ is a genus of Gram positive bacteria including at least 40 species. These include: 
      
        * _Staphylococcus aureus_ is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen. _S. aureus_ is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection, causing clinical disease in 2% of all patient admissions in the UK. Not only does it cause enormous numbers of infections, but _S. aureus_ in hospitals are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. In several industrialised nations including parts of Europe, the US and Japan, 40-60% of all hospital _S. aureus_ are now resistant to methicillin (methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, MRSA). 
        * _Staphylococcus lugdunensis_ is a commensal of man and can cause serious invasive infections. This bacterium accounts for 5-10% of cases of invasive endocarditis 
      
      _**Staphylococcus aureus**_
      
      The Sanger Institute has a program of activities focused on _Staphylococcus aureus_ including reference genomes, comparative genomics, deep sequencing within lineages, and also sampling populations.

  Streptococcus:
    description: |
      _Streptococcus_ is a genus of Gram positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. Species include: 
      
        * _Streptococcus dysgalactiae_: commonly found on the udders of cows with wild mastitis. 
        * _Streptococcus equi'_: the causative agent of Strangles, the most common infectious disease of horses. The symptoms are severe, complications are common and, at present, there is no effective treatment or vaccine for the disease. 
        * _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (the pneumococcus) which normally resides harmlessly within the human nasopharynx but is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing diseases that range in severity from meningitis, septicaemia, and pneumonia to sinusitis and acute otitis media. Rates of carriage are highest in infants and the elderly and much lower in other adults. 
        * _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (Group A Strep) strains are associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome, acute rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and others. 
        * _Streptococcus suis_ which infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. Zoonotic infections occur sporadically in Europe and North America, but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. 
        * _Streptococcus uberis_: one of the main causes of bovine mastitis. 
        * _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_: the cause of Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD) in horses.

      ###  Capsular Polysaccharide Biosynthetic Clusters
      
      The Sanger Institute was funded by [The World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/en/) to sequence each of the 90 capsular polysaccharide (_cps_) biosynthetic clusters of _S. pneumoniae_ in collaboration with Prof. Brian Spratt of the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, [Faculty of Medicine](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/), [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/), London and Dr. Margit Kaltoft of the Streptococcus Unit, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark. 
      
      Knowledge of the full complement of capsule sequences should be important for surveillance and vaccine research. 
      
      Each _cps_ cluster was amplified by long-PCR using primers in the conserved flanking _dexB_ and _aliA_ as described in [Jiang et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179285?dopt=Abstract), and the PCR product sequenced by the shotgun technique. Sizes range from 13844 to 30298 bp. 
      
      All 90 sequences are finished, annotated and [published](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/citationList.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020031).

  Streptococcus pneumoniae:
    description: |
      _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (the pneumococcus) is a facultatively anaerobic Gram positive bacterium which normally resides harmlessly within the human nasopharynx but is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing diseases that range in severity from meningitis, septicaemia, and pneumonia to sinusitis and acute otitis media. Rates of carriage are highest in infants and the elderly and much lower in other adults.

      ### Capsular Polysaccharide Biosynthetic Clusters
      
      The Sanger Institute was funded by [The World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/en/) to sequence each of the 90 capsular polysaccharide (_cps_) biosynthetic clusters of _S. pneumoniae_ in collaboration with Prof. Brian Spratt of the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, [Faculty of Medicine](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/), [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/), London and Dr. Margit Kaltoft of the Streptococcus Unit, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark. 
      
      Knowledge of the full complement of capsule sequences should be important for surveillance and vaccine research. 
      
      Each _cps_ cluster was amplified by long-PCR using primers in the conserved flanking _dexB_ and _aliA_ as described in [Jiang et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11179285?dopt=Abstract), and the PCR product sequenced by the shotgun technique. Sizes range from 13844 to 30298 bp. 
      
      All 90 sequences are finished, annotated and [published](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/citationList.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020031). Sequences are available for searching on our [Blast Server](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/s_pneumoniae). Sequences and preliminary annotations are available for download from our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/spn/final_cps_clusters/). 
      
      ### 454 Sequencing
      
      We have generated sequence data from several strains of _S. pneumoniae_ using 454/Roche rapid resequencing technology. Reads were assembled into contigs using the 454 proprietary software _newbler_, version 1.1. Contigs generated by mapped assemblies and _de novo_ assemblies are available below.

  Streptococcus suis:
    description: |
      _Streptococcus suis_ is a Gram-positive bacterium that infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. Zoonotic infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America, but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. 
      
      We have sequenced the whole genome sequences of three _Streptococcus suis_ strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs, and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. 
      
      The strains are: 
      
        * P1/7 was isolated from an ante-mortem blood culture from a pig dying with meningitis, and is sequence type (ST)1 by MLST 
        * BM407 was isolated from CSF from a human case of meningitis in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2004, and is is ST1 
        * SC84 was isolated from a case of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome in Sichuan Province, China in 2005, and is is ST7, a single locus varient of ST1 
      
      We have also undertaken some deep sequencing within the ST1 lineages, examining human and pig isolates from in and around Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

      _Streptomyces coelicolor_ A3(2) is the model representative of a group of soil-dwelling organisma with a complex lifecycle involving mycelial growth and spore formation. These microbes are notable for their production of pharmaceutically useful compound including anti-tumour agents, immunosupressants and over two-thirds of all natural antibiotics currently available 
      
      The Sanger Institute completed the sequencing of the _Streptomyces coelicolor_ A3(2) genome in collaboration with Prof. David Hopwood of the John Innes Centre. The sequence was generated using a clone-by-clone approach, initially using cosmids generated and mapped by David Hopwood's group at the John Innes Centre, and latterly using a BAC library to fill gaps and confirm the map.

  Vibrio cholerae:
    description: |
      _Vibrio cholerae_ is the causative agent of cholera, an acute life-threatening diarrhoeal disease endemic in many developing countries and responsible for seven pandemics. There are more than 200 known serogroups of _Vibrio cholerae_, however only two, O1 and O139 cause cholera. _V. cholerae_ O139 strains were identified as the causative agent for a cholera epidemic that broke out in parts of Bangladesh and India between 1992 and 1993. These serotypes are further differentiated into two biotypes (Classical and El Tor) based on genotypic and phenotypic differences. Since 1817 all of the early pandemics were exclusively attributable to strains of the classical biotype. However, by the 1960’s El Tor replaced the classical biotype as the major cause of cholera. The re-emergence of classical strains in Bangladesh in 1982 resulted in a temporal overlap during which both biotypes co-existed for around a decade, however the classical biotype now seems to be extinct. New hybrid variants of V. cholerae O1 that display representative traits of both biotypes have recently been isolated. Thus, genotypic traits that have traditionally been viewed as distinguishing features of a particular biotype are now of limited value. Our current work is aimed at understanding the sequence diversity held within this species.

  Yersinia:
    description: |
      The yersiniae are Gram-negative rods belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. They consist of 11 species that have been traditionally distinguished by DNA-DNA hybridisation and biochemical analyses. Three of them are pathogenic to humans: _Yersinia pestis_ and the enteropathogenic yersiniae, _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_. All three species target the lymph tissues during infection and carry a 70 kb virulence plasmid (pYV), which is essential for infection in these tissues as well as to overcome host defense mechanisms. We have generated reference genomes for two of the human pathogenic Yersinia: _Y. pestis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. 
      
      The genome of _Y. pestis_ is punctuated with pseudogenes demonstrating that despite its high virulence _Y. pestis_ is in the early stage of genome decay, eliminating genes no longer required outside it mammalian host. 
      
      _Yersinia enterocolitica_ is a psychotropic bacterium, which causes acute gastro-enteritis and occasionally more serious disease in humans. In some countries it rivals Salmonella as a food borne pathogen and because it can grow at refrigeration temperature it is an increasing concern in terms of food safety. _Y. enterocolitica_ has evolved into an apparently heterogeneous collection of organisms encompassing six biotypes differentiated by biochemical tests (1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4 and 5). These in vitro biotypes group into three distinct grades of pathogen: a historically defined non-pathogenic group (biogroup 1A); a weakly pathogenic group that are unable to kill mice (biogroups 2 to 5); and a highly pathogenic, mouse-lethal group (biogroup 1B). These biogroups have geographically distinct distributions with biotype 1B being most frequently isolated in North America (termed the ‘New-World’ strains), whereas biogroups 2-5 predominate in Europe and Japan (termed the ‘Old-World’ strains), with biotype 1A strains ubiquitous in the environment. 
      
      We have determined the genome sequence of _Y. enterocolitica_ biotype 1B. Our current interests are to determine the genetic differences that define the biotypes and to look at global diversity of the _Y. enterocolitica_ biotypes.
