  title: Public Health England reference collections
  description: |
    This project aims to provide annotated and assembled genomes for 3,000 bacteria and
    500 viruses as part of a new eResource

    The project is split into two parts:

    ** NCTC 3000 ** : A joint collaboration between Public Health England, Pacific
    Biosciences and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to complete the sequencing
    of 3,000 bacterial strains from PHE's National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC)
    using Pacific Biosciences' Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technology. 

    ** NCPV 500 ** : A collaboration between PHE and Sanger to produce 500 viral genomes
    from PHE's National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV) using the Illumina
    sequencing platform. 

    Collectively, the data generated will be housed in a publically accessible
    web-based eResource that integrates metadata and genome sequences for type and
    reference strains of biomedically important bacterial and viral pathogens.
    This resource will integrate accession, taxonomy and authentication
    information with publications, genome sequences, comparative analysis
    databases and other resources at EMBL and NCBI.

    This is a community resource project. Data will be available from here, and
    from the NCTC. We will submit assembled, annotated sequences to the
    International Sequence Databases as they become available. We request that you
    cite this webpage in any publication using the data, and would appreciate it
    if you contact us to discuss the use of this data.

    ####  Data Downloads

      * [ Download annotated assemblies ](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/pathogens/NCTC3000/)
      * [ BLAST server ](/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/nctc/)

    ** Please note: ** these are pre-submission assemblies that should not be treated as final versions. Assemblies contain both chromosomal and plasmid contigs. 

    ####  Background

    The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute will generate PacBio sequencing data and
    provide assembled and annotated genomes for the 3,000 bacteria from the NCTC
    collection.

    The NCTC is one of the world's premier collections for bacterial strains, but
    most bacteria in NCTC currently have no genome references. Biological Resource
    Centres, such as NCTC and NCPV, are a vital part of the infrastructure
    underpinning life sciences, providing biomaterials of known provenance. Type
    and reference strains act as landmarks for mapping microbial diversity and
    measuring unique changes in properties and patterns of infection and response
    to clinical interventions. Combining reference genomes with the wealth of
    historical and biological information existing for these strains will generate
    a data set of enormous value for basic and clinical microbiology.

    Pacific Biosciences' Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing technology
    achieves very long reads and high consensus accuracy, greatly improving the
    ability to finish bacterial genomes. And, because the technology can directly
    detect base modifications, the epigenomes for bacteria can also be obtained
    with no additional data acquisition, and this data will also be provided.

    ####  NCTC Strains

    As bacterial strains from the collection progress through the project, links
    to the raw sequence data, epigenome data and annotated assemblies will appear
    here.

    ####  NCPV strains

    As viral strains from the collection progress through the project, links to
    the raw sequence data and annotated assemblies will appear here.
